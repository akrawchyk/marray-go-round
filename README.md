# Marray Go Round

Example project developed as a lab for General Assembly's Front-End Web Development course. Aims to teach students how to use arrays by creating an image carousel with each image's URI stored in an array index.

The name is a knock-off of the classic carinval ride, the [Merry Go Round](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Merry_go_round).
